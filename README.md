# CNUS_Packer
 Port of NUSPacker in C# to remove the dependency of Java.
 
 Thanks to Morilli (https://github.com/Morilli) who helped developing this port.
 
You need to install the .Net Core 2.1 Framework (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.1.12-windows-x64-installer)
 
This tool allows you to convert the code/content/meta folders of a WiiU Game/Homebrew to the installable format for the WiiU
 
Usage:

CNUSPACKER.exe -in <input_dir> -out <output_dir> -encryptKeyWith <commonKey>

Enjoy.
